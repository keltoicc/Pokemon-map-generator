# Pokémon Map Generator

This program is a Pokémon map generator developed in Python. It allows you to create coherent maps and visualize them in the console using characters representing different types of terrain.

## Installation

To use this map generator, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project folder.
3. Run the program with the following command:
   python main.py

## Usage

When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter the width and height of the map you want to generate. You will also be asked to choose a biome for the map, which will affect the probabilities of different types of terrain.

Choose the size of the map and the biome, and the generator will automatically create a coherent map with appropriate terrains.
